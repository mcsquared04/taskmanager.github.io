I will break the manual down by tab groupings.

Site: This tab is a simple way to set your working space.
Users have three options to set a background color, either ivory, muted pink, or muted blue (my three favorite colors). Once a user has selected a background color, they may toggle between navigation tabs and keep this selected color.
Users have three music choices, either soothing Nintendo music, Studio Ghibli soundtrack piano music, or New Jeans in a jazz style. The music toggle is a preview before the user gets started on their tasks. I would recommend users to sample each music choice so they may go to their tasks and immediately choose their music and get working without spending more time getting distracted trying to choose the music.

Monday-Sunday: These tabs are your daily tasks.
First, select a music choice to play.
Then, users should input a task with a deadline. This will create a list of tasks that includes a countdown toward the deadline. No matter what order you input your tasks in, the tasks will be organized by deadline, with highest priority at the top. This makes it easy for the user to see what to focus on. Once a user has completed their task, they can click the "X" box next to the task to delete it from the list.
